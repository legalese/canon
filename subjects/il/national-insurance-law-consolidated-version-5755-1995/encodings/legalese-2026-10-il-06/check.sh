# Run every .l4 module in an encoding and print, per module, the numbers that matter:
# error diagnostics, assertions satisfied, assertions failed, assertions refused.
#
# Why not trust the exit code: `l4 run` exits 0 when an #ASSERT fails AND when it
# refuses. An encoding that "ran green" by exit code can be carrying either.
#
# Why read the line AFTER "Message:": l4 prints some outcomes on the Message line
# itself ("Message:  assertion failed") and others on the next one:
#   * `#ASSERT REFUSED e` where e produces a value: "assertion failed: expected a
#     refusal, but the expression produced a value" (Error severity);
#   * `#ASSERT e` where e REFUSES: "assertion refused: ..." (Warning severity, so it
#     never shows up as an error at all).
# A script that greps the Message line alone undercounts the first and never sees the
# second; a refusing assertion then looks green.
#
# Usage:  check.sh [DIR]          (DIR defaults to the directory this script is in)
# Env:    L4   the l4 binary      (default: `l4` on PATH)
#
# Exit status: 0 only when no module has an error other than its expected failed
# assertions, and each module fails exactly as often as expected_failed says and refuses
# exactly as often as expected_refused says (0 for every module but the ones it names;
# version 0.2.0, as row IL-04's check.sh does).
